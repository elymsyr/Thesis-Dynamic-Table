# Dynamic Table

## About <a name = "about"></a>

Hello! I am just learning and testing here. Everything will change soon. The project purpose is to train a dynamic table to move an object from a location on table to a target location.

### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

<!-- #### CPU Training (For an Older Version of the Repo)

Download ML Agents package from Unity Package Manager.
Create a new python (version 3.9.13) venv with the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
Test the mlagents by writing on cmd 'mlagents-learn -h' after activating the environment.

#### GPU Training

Download ML Agents package from Unity Package Manager.
Create a  conda (with python version 3.9.13) venv with the [requirements.txt](Docs/requirements.txt) (use pip install -r requirements.txt) file.
Upgrade and add some packages to conda venv -> pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel, pip install nvidia-pyindex, conda install cuda -c nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0
Download Cuda11.8 and Visual Studio (I use 2019. 2022 does not work.).
Test cuda -> open cmd, type python, import torch, print(torch.cuda.is_available()) -> expect true
Test the mlagents by writing on cmd 'mlagents-learn -h' after activating the environment.
You can check [requirementsConda.txt](Docs/requirementsConda.txt). -->

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Open cmd and activate the venv. Type 'mlagents-learn --run-id TestID'. Start training by pressing the Play button in the Unity Editor.
Or just press the Play button in the Unity Editor to use heuristics.
